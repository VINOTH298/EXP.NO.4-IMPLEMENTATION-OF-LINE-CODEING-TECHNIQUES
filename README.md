# EXP.NO.4-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-LINE-CODEING-TECHNIQUES

3.Implementation of Line Codeing Techniques 
  
## AIM    
 The objective of this experiment is to study the Line coding techniques using the trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE

1.Power ON the line coding trainer kit and ensure all modules are working properly.

2.Select the Data Source:

Use either a built-in switch arrangement to generate a binary sequence (e.g., 1011001) or input an external signal from a function generator.

3.Connect the Circuit:

4.Connect the data input to the encoding section.

Use patch cords to connect the encoder output to an oscilloscope.

5.Select the Line Coding Scheme:

Use the selector switches or buttons on the trainer kit to choose one of the available coding techniques: NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, Manchester, AMI.

6.Observe the Output Waveform:

Use the CRO/DSO to view the output signal.

Carefully observe how the signal changes based on the input data and the coding method.

Adjust time/div and volt/div settings for better clarity.

7.Record Observations:

Sketch or capture screenshots of the waveforms for each technique.

Note characteristics such as signal transitions, polarity, mid-bit changes, and DC content.

8.Repeat for All Techniques:

Repeat steps 4â€“6 for all the available line coding techniques.
